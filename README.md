# testing-competition
Inspired by Spotify's testing-game, discover who contributed most to your test base

# TODOs
Personal list of things I'd like to add:
- a class that take ContributionCounter and do an output (stdout or file)
- more language identifiers: Java, C, JS ? different test frameworks?
- allow to tune language identifiers with config files (test_* vs *_test)
- add pytest-cov and more tests :)
- something better than parsing "git blame"?
